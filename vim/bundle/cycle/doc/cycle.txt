ABOUT                                           *cycle*

Cycle.vim allows you to toggle between pairs or lists of related words. The
default mappings are the same as those with which you can increment and
decrement a number under the cursor — <C-A> and <C-X>, respectively.

CUSTOMIZATION

You can add your own word groups:
>
 call AddCycleGroup(['one', 'two', 'three'])
<
To deal with conflicts, Cycle.vim also supports adding groups that are specific
to a certain filetype:
>
  call AddCycleGroup('ruby', ['class', 'module'])
  call AddCycleGroup('python', ['else', 'elif'])
<
When multiple groups define the same word, groups belonging to specific
filetypes will be used instead of global groups. This is useful in the cases
above, since in HTML we would want 'class' to cycle with 'id' and Python uses
'elif' while some other languages use 'else if' or 'elsif'.

Providing a list of filetypes is also supported:
>
  call AddCycleGroup(['ruby', 'eruby', 'perl'], ['else', 'elsif'])
<
However, if there are no conflicting cases it is preferable to define all
cycle groups in the global namespace, using filetype-specific groups only in
case of conflict.

Matches are evaluated in reverse order, so whatever has been defined most
recently will take precedence over groups defined previously. Keep this in
mind when defining new cycle groups to make sure broad definitions are not
matched when they are not desired.

# Markdown Vim Mode

Syntax highlighting, matching rules and mappings for [the original Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) and extensions.

## Installation

If you use [Vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/vundle), add the following line to your `~/.vimrc`:

    Bundle 'plasticboy/vim-markdown'

And then run inside Vim:

    :so ~/.vimrc
    :BundleInstall

If you use [Pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen), do this:

    $ cd ~/.vim/bundle
    $ git clone https://github.com/plasticboy/vim-markdown.git

To install without Pathogen using the Debian [vim-addon-manager](http://packages.qa.debian.org/v/vim-addon-manager.html), do this:

    $ git clone https://github.com/plasticboy/vim-markdown.git
    $ cd vim-markdown
    $ sudo make install
    $ vim-addon-manager install mkd

If you are not using any package manager, download the [tarball](https://github.com/plasticboy/vim-markdown/archive/master.tar.gz) and do this:

    $ cd ~/.vim
    $ tar --strip=1 -zxf vim-markdown-master.tar.gz

## Options

**Disable Folding**

Add the following line to your `.vimrc` to disable folding.

```vim
let g:vim_markdown_folding_disabled=1
```

**Set Initial Foldlevel**

Add the following line to your `.vimrc` to set the initial foldlevel. This option defaults to 0 (i.e. all folds are closed) and is ignored if folding is disabled.

```vim
let g:vim_markdown_initial_foldlevel=1
```

## Mappings

The following work on normal and visual modes:

- `]]`: go to next header.
- `[[`: go to previous header. Contrast with `]c`.
- `][`: go to next sibling header if any.
- `[]`: go to previous sibling header if any.
- `]c`: go to Current header.
- `]u`: go to parent header (Up).
